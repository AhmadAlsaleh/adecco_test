# adecco_ahmad_test

This project is a test with "Accedo" Company
it is a login page with restful api post request to check the username and password
in this project calling api is commented, because we do not have backend now
so we have used static username and password "alsaleh.ahmad.a@gmail.com" and "12345678" for password
we use SharedPreferences to save the login details
